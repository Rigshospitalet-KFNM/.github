All self-developed software that is either running clinically or scientify should have their own repostitory. 

If you have a collections of scripts you should create a respository for these as well, however you should specify the functionality within those scripts. If other respositories covers the functionality of our code then you do not have to create a repository for it, instead you should use the code in those repositories.

If you create a repsitory, you should add it with a small description to the list below

# List of Repositories

* gfr - Django server running software for Clearance i the capital Region of Copenhagen.
* Tracershop - Django / React Server For ordering radioactive tracers produced at Rigshospitalet.
